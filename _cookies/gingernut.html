An ginger nut biscuit is a traditional New Zealand biscuit made from flour, butter, cornflakes, sugar and cocoa powder,
 topped with chocolate icing and a half walnut. The recipe[1] has a high proportion of butter, and relatively low sugar,
  and no leavening (rising agent), giving it a soft, dense and rich texture, with crunchiness from the cornflakes, 
  rather than from a high sugar content.
